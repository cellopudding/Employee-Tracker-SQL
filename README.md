# EMPLOYEE TRACKER WITH SQL

## Description 

**User Story:**\
AS A business owner\
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company\
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

**Solution:**\
To fulfull the needs of this user story, I created a command-line application 
that dynamically operates an employee tracker system. The system allows you to view, add, and update 
your employee databse so that the user can effectively manage their team.
